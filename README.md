# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Python-based Tic Tac Toe game is a classic implementation of the popular two-player strategy game. This game allows you to play against a computer opponent, making it a fun and challenging experience. Here's a description of the key features and gameplay:

**Game Description:**
This Python Tic Tac Toe game is designed to be played on the command line. It offers a user-friendly interface, allowing you to compete against a computer opponent. The game follows traditional Tic Tac Toe rules, where two players take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a line of three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

**Key Features:**

1. **Player vs. Computer:** You can choose to play as 'X' while the computer takes on the 'O' role. The computer uses a simple AI algorithm to make strategic moves.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The game provides a clear and intuitive command-line interface, making it easy for players to input their moves.

3. **Winning Conditions:** The game checks for winning conditions after every move and declares a winner when one of the players has achieved three in a row.

4. **Tie Game:** If the grid is filled, and no player has won, the game declares a draw.

5. **Play Again:** After the game ends, you have the option to play again, providing endless opportunities for enjoyment and practice.

**Gameplay:**

1. You start by specifying your move as row and column coordinates (e.g., "row 1, column 2"). The computer will then make its move.

2. The game continues with players taking turns until one of them wins or the game ends in a tie.

3. If you win, the game displays a congratulatory message, while a tie game is followed by a message indicating the draw.

4. You can choose to play as many games as you want, making it a great way to refine your strategy and enjoy some leisure time.

**Benefits:**
- Provides a challenging and interactive gaming experience.
- A fun way to practice and improve your strategy in Tic Tac Toe.
- Offers a convenient and engaging way to spend free time, all within a Python environment.

This Python Tic Tac Toe game with a computer opponent is an entertaining and educational project that allows you to enhance your strategic thinking while enjoying a classic game. It's a great example of how programming can be used to create fun and interactive applications.
